You've heard of inbox bankruptcy. I'm embarking on Ɛmail armageddon.

I've found that my inbox has become a cocktail party I'm no longer interested in attending.

There's a bouncer at the spam door, but he's just looking for crocks and jorts.

If our inboxes were like our physical homes, we'd be frantically calling the police.

We'd be reporting hundreds of intruders relentlessly knocking on our door to sell us things we don't need, inviting us to drinks we don't want to drink, reminding us we haven't answered their knocks at the door, and proposing we meet up for no particular reason (though it's been forever).

Email shows up naked and making rutting movements in our front yards. 

Whoever got there first, gets to our mind first.

"You've got mail" is no longer cute, it's a summons.

Unfortunately, there is no restraining order for the Internet. There is no virtual police force to honor your consent. The Federal Communications Commission still requires Tariffs and rate cards for telegrams, but is completely silent on email.

You are your only filter, and our modern Inbox was designed to bet you can't check just one © .

The vast majority of my Inbox is junk food for the mind.

I love the heartfelt emails I've collected over the years, but those messages are such a small fraction of what I'm assaulted with daily that I'm willing to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

```
Dear Inbox,
We've been to 0 together,
I'm going to 1 alone.
```

Effort and cost (social and $) was once required to inhabit a fellow fellow's mind. You had to send a letter of introduction through a trusted contact. There were gatekeepers (literally and figuratively). You had to pay the government to transport a small piece of paper across the country.

In the way back machine, you simply had to wait in a well-appointed vestibule until such time as the inhabitant was ready to engage.

Or, as I intend to do, trust physical reality as my inbox.

```
This is my sorrowful goodbyte

To the messages I'll never read
To the dinners I may miss

To Inbox's siren song of humanity
Waiting patiently
to crash my attention onto the rocks

Fill my ears with wax
Tie me to the mast through these waters
```
